      <h2>Label</h2>

      Notice the use of the <label> element in the example above. <br/>

      The <label> tag defines a label for many form elements. <br/>
      
      The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focus on the input element. <br/>
      
      The <label> element also help users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox. <br/>
      
      The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together. <br/>
